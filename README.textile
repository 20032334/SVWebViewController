_IMPORTANT: on Oct 26th 2011, SVWebViewController received a major overhaul of its inner working. Upgrading from an earlier version of a SVWebViewController will crash your app if you're presenting SVWebViewController modally (using @presentModalViewController:@). Please update your code and use @SVModalWebViewController@ in replacement of @SVWebViewController@ when it's presented modally._

h1. SVWebViewController

is a simple inline browser for iOS. The iPhone UI is highly based on Tweetie's inline browser, and the iPad version on "Reeder":http://reederapp.com/ipad/.

**SVWebViewController features:**

* iPhone and iPad distinct UIs
* full landscape orientation support
* back, forward, stop/refresh and action buttons (with actions "Open in Safari" and "Mail Link")
* navbar title set to the currently visible web page
* talks with @setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible@

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVWebViewController/SVWebViewController@ folder into your project. 
* Add the *MessageUI* framework to your project

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

Just like any UIViewController, SVWebViewController can be pushed into a UINavigationController stack:

<pre>
SVWebViewController *webViewController = [[SVWebViewController alloc] initWithAddress:@"http://google.com"];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:webViewController animated:YES];
[webViewController release];
</pre>

It can also be presented modally using @SVModalWebViewController@:

<pre>
SVModalWebViewController *webViewController = [[SVModalWebViewController alloc] initWithAddress:@"http://google.com"];
[self presentModalViewController:webViewController animated:YES];	
[webViewController release];
</pre>

@SVModalWebViewController@ boasts a @barsTintColor@ property, if you're into giving the navigation bar and toolbar a custom tint color.

h3. Customizing the action sheet

Use the @availableActions@ integer bit mask property to set which actions should be available for display:

<pre>
enum {
    SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsNone             = 0,
    SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsOpenInSafari     = 1 << 0,
    SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsMailLink         = 1 << 1,
    SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsCopyLink         = 1 << 2
};
</pre>

Default is @SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsOpenInSafari | SVWebViewControllerAvailableActionsMailLink@.

h2. Automatic Referencing counting (ARC) support

Maintaining an official ARC branch has proven to be too much work, often leading to confusion since the ARC branch is always a few commits behind. If you'd like to use SVWebViewController in your ARC-enabled project, you'll have to "add the @-fno-objc-arc@ compiler flag":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project to all of SVWebViewController's files.
