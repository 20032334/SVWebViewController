h1. SVWebViewController

is a simple inline browser for iOS. The iPhone UI is highly based on Tweetie's inline browser, and the iPad version on "Reeder":http://reederapp.com/ipad/. 

SVWebViewController features:

* iPhone and iPad distinct UIs
* landscape orientation support (iPad only)
* back, forward, stop/refresh and action buttons (with actions "Open in Safari" and "Email this")
* navbar auto-creation depending on how controller is presented (modaly or pushed in nav controller)
* navbar title set to the currently visible web page
* talks with @setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible@

h2. Installation

Easiest way to install is to drag the @SVWebViewController/SVWebViewController@ folder from the Finder directly into your project. That will add the SVWebViewController controller class, the .xib file and the image ressources to your project. SVWebViewController requires the *MessageUI* framework, so make sure you add that to your project as well.

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Sample@)

Just like any UIViewController, SVWebViewController can be pushed into a UINavigationController stack:

<pre>
SVWebViewController *webViewController = [[SVWebViewController alloc] initWithAddress:@"http://google.com"];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:webViewController animated:YES];
[webViewController release];
</pre>

or be presented modally on top of the currently visible view controller:

<pre>
SVWebViewController *webViewController = [[SVWebViewController alloc] initWithAddress:@"http://google.com"];
[self presentModalViewController:webViewController animated:YES];	
[webViewController release];
</pre>
